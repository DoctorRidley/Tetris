# Tetris

## Description
Tetris is a game where the player controls falling blocks. The player sorts the blocks to make a line. If a line is created, the player's score increases and the line disappears. Any stationary blocks above the line automatically come down. The amount of spaces the stationary blocks move is equivalent to the amount of lines the player creates. Falling blocks can stack up on each other. If the blocks stack up to the spawn point, no more blocks will stack up, causing the player to lose.
